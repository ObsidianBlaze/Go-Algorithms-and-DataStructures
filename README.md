-  **Day to 0**:
   Stick to a programming language like C or C++. Make sure that you are comfortable with pointers/objects.

-  **Day 1**:
   Understand the concept of Algorithmic complexity. Skip the theory for now, but for every piece of code you write, you should be able to derive both time and space complexity.

-  **Day 2 - 10**:
   Let’s start with some simple data structures,
   1. Arrays
   2. Linked Lists
   3. Strings
   4. Stacks
   5. Queues
   
   Understand their basic operations (insert, delete, search, traversal) and their complexity - Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet, and code them all.

-  **Day 11 - 25**:
   Let’s now learn some simple algorithms,

   1. **Sorting** - Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Bucket sort, Counting sort, Radix sort, External sorting
   2. **Search** - Linear search, Binary Search (along with its variants).
   3. **Prime Numbers** - Sieve of Eratosthenes, Primality test
   4. **Strings** - String searching, LCS, Palindrome detection
   5. **Miscellaneous** - Euclidean algorithm, Matrix multiplication, Fibonacci Numbers, Pascal's Triangle, Max Subarray problem

-  **Day 26 - 50**:
   Once you are comfortable with everything above, start doing problems from,
   1. Cracking the Coding Interview
   2. Elements of Programming Interviews
   3. Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job
   4. GeeksforGeeks
   5. HackerRank
   6. InterviewBit
   Stick to chapters of arrays, linked lists, strings, stacks, queues and complexity.

-  **Day 51 - 60**: Let’s learn some non-linear data structures,
   1. Tree
      -  Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree - Tree traversals, Lowest common ancestor, Depth, Height & Diameter, Finding k-th smallest element
      -  Heaps
   2. Hash table - 4 sum problem, Checking if sudoku solution is valid
   3. Graph - Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Topological sorting, Minimum spanning tree, Shortest path problem,
- **Day 61- 90**: Refer to the previous resources and start doing problems from trees, hash tables, heaps and graphs.

- **Day 91 - 100**: Understand Computational complexity theory and NP-completeness, Knapsack problem, Travelling salesman problem, SAT problem and so on.

- **Day 101 - [...]**: You are now better than most of the CS undergrads. Keep revising the above topics and start competitive programming! Good luck!
